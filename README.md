## Synopsis

**Beamer-flex** is an adaptation of the LyX layout for the Beamer document class that uses Flex Insets for Frames, for Columns, and for Blocks, instead of paragraph environments.

## Installation

Place `beamer-flex.inc`, `beamer-flex.layout`, and `beamer-flex.module` in your layouts directory.

## Use

* For a new presentation, select the document class *Beamer (flex insets)*.

* To convert an existing document using the Beamer layout, select the module *Beamer (flex)*. After manual conversion, the document class can be changed for *Beamer (flex insets)* and the module removed.

See the manual and example `Beamer-flex.lyx`.
